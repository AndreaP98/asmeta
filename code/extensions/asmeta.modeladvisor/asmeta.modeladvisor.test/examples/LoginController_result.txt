MP: Conditional rule eval to true
ConditionalRule "if eq(current_state,CANCELLED) then endif" never executes the then branch
ConditionalRule "if eq(current_state,ERROR) then endif" never executes the then branch
ConditionalRule "if eq(current_state,LOGINERROR) then endif" never executes the then branch
ConditionalRule "if eq(event,INTENT_CONTINUE) then endif" never executes the then branch

MP: Domain all used.
Domain States could be reduced in size. Elements {CANCELLED, ERROR, LOGINERROR} could be removed.

MP: Controlled location takes all values.
Function audio should be removed, because it's never used.
Function camera should be removed, because it's never used.
Function displaytouch should be removed, because it's never used.
Function keyboard should be removed, because it's never used.
Function keyboardbacklight should be removed, because it's never used.
Function current_state does not take the values {CANCELLED, ERROR, LOGINERROR} of its domain. It could be defined over the smaller domain {ACTIVE, IDLE, LOGGEDIN, LOGINTIMEOUT, TRYING_TO_LOGIN}.
