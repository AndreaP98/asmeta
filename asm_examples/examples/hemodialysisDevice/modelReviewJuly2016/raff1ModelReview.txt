MP2: Every case rule without otherwise must be complete
NONE

MP3: Choose rule is always/sometimes/never not empty
NONE

MP3: Forall rule is always/sometimes/never not empty
forall $alarmon in ErrorAlarmType with alarm($alarmon) is sometimes empty (but not always).

MP3: Conditional rule eval to true
NONE

MP4: No assignment is always trivial
NONE

MP5: For every domain element e, there exists a location which has value e
Domain MachineState could be reduced in size. Elements {MAIN_FLOW} could be removed.
Domain SignalLamps could be reduced in size. Elements {RED} could be removed.

MP6: Every controlled location can take any value in its codomain
Function machine_state does not take the values {MAIN_FLOW} of its domain. It could be defined over the smaller domain {BYPASS}.
Function signal_lamp does not take the values {RED} of its domain. It could be defined over the smaller domain {GREEN, YELLOW}.

MP7: a location could be removed
NONE

MP7: a controlled location is never updated
Location machine_state is never updated.

MP7: a controlled location could be static
Controlled location machine_state could be defined static. It's initialized to BYPASS and never changes its value.
Controlled function machine_state could be defined static. All its locations are initialized and never change their values.
