NONE

MP3: Choose rule is always/sometimes/never not empty
NONE

MP3: Forall rule is always/sometimes/never not empty
forall $alarmon in ErrorAlarmType with alarm($alarmon) is sometimes empty (but not always).

MP3: Conditional rule eval to true
NONE

MP4: No assignment is always trivial
Trivial update of location signal_lamp. When the condition is (TRUE & (phase = INITIATION) & (initPhase = CONNECT_PATIENT) & (patientPhase = END_CONN)) its value is always the same of the term GREEN.
Trivial update of location error(UF_DIR). When the condition is (TRUE & errorExist & (error(UF_DIR) & (alarm(UF_DIR) = FALSE)) & error_UF_dir_resolved) its value is always the same of the term TRUE.
Trivial update of location error(UF_RATE). When the condition is (TRUE & errorExist & (error(UF_RATE) & (alarm(UF_RATE) = FALSE)) & error_UF_rate_resolved) its value is always the same of the term TRUE.

Function signal_lamp does not take the values {RED} of its domain. It could be defined over the smaller domain {GREEN, YELLOW}.
Location error(ARTERIAL_BOLUS_END) does not take the values {TRUE} of its domain. It could be defined over the smaller domain {FALSE}.
Location error(UF_BYPASS) does not take the values {TRUE} of its domain. It could be defined over the smaller domain {FALSE}.
Location error(UF_VOLUME_ERR) does not take the values {TRUE} of its domain. It could be defined over the smaller domain {FALSE}.
